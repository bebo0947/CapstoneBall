                                     
                                       ##### Webscraping plan: #####

Scrape position (and potentially age, country, and other data) data, either from FBref or TransferMrkt.com 
- associating player name with position

Scrape European data for as far back as 2017/2018
- this will leave us with 2024 / 2025 - 2017/2018 csv files  ~ 8 sheets
- for each of those csv, clean it up in whatever way necessary
join them together, ensuring we store each year as a different version of each player.
- at approximately 3000 players per year, this would mean the main sheet has 
  approximately 8 * 3,000 = 24,000 rows, each one being an annual version of a player. 

Join the two tables together, giving the players more detailed position data than the 
  original FBref position data. 


So our final sheet will have 24,000 rows, each row representing a version of a player 
  from a specific season. 
Need to figure out what to do with players are too young. 0s for the empty seasons
  Nvm, recall that the rows we are getting is by year, so only players that existed 
  at that time would have entries (so a player that is too young for an earlier year, 
  or a player that is retired for a later year just wouldn't have a version of that 
  player)

                                        ##### Big Picture #####
How I see the model working:
  For all the players, we use our model to predict the players next season. 
  Next, we compare that predicted next season to the 'avg' of the inputted players
    recent (??) seasons. I guess for each player, we generate some kind of RSS to see
    how far off the potential choice is from the inputted player. I assume this RSS 
    will give different weights to different stats / residuals based on position?
  Pick the player that minimizes the RSS


                                   ##### The potential use cases: #####

player is injured and we need a quick replacement
player contract is ending and we need a permanent replacement
even just trying to frame the potential career of young players. 
  

                                         ##### Resources: #####

Small cases: FBref compare player option. 
             We can use this to test the RSS techniques 
Transfermarkt: Get position data
               Age data
               Injury data
               Transfer data
               Trophy data ??
               Value data??
EA Career Mode: Try and figure out how they try to predict players potentials.  



                                          ##### Problems: #####
Webscraping vs excel
getting precise position data => labour intensive joining
  - Webscraping Transfermarkt.com and joining it with FBref data
what does 'replace' mean      => mathematically intensive
  - Example, how do we formalize vini replacing ronaldo
  - Example, Real madrid midfield
  - Example, barcas inability to replace messi e.g ansu fati
what does 'similar' mean      => football intensive
  - predict a players next season, 
    then find RSS between that predicted season and inputted players recent seasons
    then find the player that minimizes it
Enumerating positions
  - does it make sense to maintain the order of positions the further up the field you go?
