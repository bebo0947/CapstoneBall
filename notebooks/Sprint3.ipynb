    "#### Some initial thoughts\n",
    "Following are some initial thoughts I was planning on tackling this problem that couldnt take off the ground, and whose EDA/planning was too messy/incoherent to make it to this notebook.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I was looking to treat each datapoint as a sentence in typical RNN fashion. This would skip the usual token vectorization since the data is already numeric. However, now comes the question of 'what is a datapoint?' for any given player, do we have 7 datapoints (one for each season) of sentence length 160 and we try to predict the entire next year, or do we have 160 datapoints (one for each feature) of size 7 and we try to predict the next element of that features sequence?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The issue with the first way is that sentences are extremely long and the idea of generating sentences that way can lead to 'jumbled sentenced'. The issue with the second way is that we have to teach 160 models how to interact with each other and we lose any value of using NNs due to lack of interaction of features. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Whilst the second approach makes no sense to use, the first approach has somoe promise, with some alterations to the structure of the data and the preprocessing techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The approach\n",
    "1. We will runn a similar 'cleaning' operation on the entire dataset to mae sure each player has only one datapoint per season\n",
    "2. For our first attempt we will also filter to only players that have datapoints for every season (so we dont have to worry about putting NaNs into the model) and only try to predict our previously defined 'impact' metrics\n",
    "3. Generate the cleaned 3D matrix and to a traintest separate X_train and Y_train\n",
    "4. train a simple (not too many layers/ big layers) LTSM NN \n",
    "5. evaluate\n",
    "##### Problems with Approach 1\n",
    "- Missing important players (obv)\n",
    "- Bias towards aging players or players on teams that stay up\n",
    "##### Places to progress\n",
    "- train on everything. This will require different preprocessing\n",
    "- train on all players. Will also require funky preprocessing.\n",
    "- bigger NN\n",
    "- different activations\n",
    "- combine all the above. \n"
